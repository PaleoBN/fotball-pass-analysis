# Football Pass Analysis using K-Means Clustering

This project explores passing patterns in professional football matches using event data.
The goal is to identify spatial clusters of passes and visualize areas with high and low passing activity.

## Data
- Event data provided by StatsBomb (via statsbombpy)
- Match example: Bayer Leverkusen vs Werder Bremen (2024-04-14)

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python
- K-Means clustering on pass start locations
- Visualization using mplsoccer and matplotlib

## Key Insights
- Identification of pitch zones with high and low pass density
- Clear spatial separation of passing behaviors

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- mplsoccer

## Motivation
This project was developed out of personal interest in football analytics.
I am particularly interested in applying data analysis techniques to the sporting context.
